# Changelog

All notable changes to Gondolin are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Fix `chmod` on hostfs and memfs VFS mounts #115

## 0.12.0

- Add `VM.getHostPid()` to allow callers to collect host-side process metrics of the VM runner. #114

## 0.11.0

- Add conservative QEMU auto-pause for idle macOS/HVF sandboxes, with guest activity tracking and configurable `qemuIdlePauseMs`. #112

## 0.10.0

- Added runtime rootfs sizing via `rootfs.size` / `--rootfs-size`, growing the writable disk and running `resize2fs` in the guest. #94

## 0.9.1

- Replace deprecated `UV_NATIVE_TLS` with `UV_SYSTEM_CERTS` in guest init environments #98
- Replace the workflow Zig setup action with a checked-in installer for more reliable CI/release builds #102
- Update the built-in sandbox helper registry with the `gondolin:0.9.0` helper bundles

## 0.9.0

- Add packaged sandbox helper bundles for `gondolin build`, allowing published installs to build images without a local Zig toolchain #99
- Add QEMU CPU model override support for architecture/host compatibility #96
- Fix HTTP hook secret scoping so secret host rules no longer implicitly depend on the global allowlist #93
- Upgrade guest and krun runner builds to Zig 0.16.0

## 0.8.1

- Fixed CommonJS consumers by restoring the `require` export entrypoint #97
- Updated the built-in image registry so `alpine-base:latest` points to `alpine-base:0.2.0`

## 0.8.0

- Fixed checkpoint resume to avoid overwriting the source checkpoint when resuming into the same path
- Fixed WebSocket proxying through `httpHooks` by re-injecting upgrade headers stripped by WHATWG `Request` handling #83
- Fixed ingress proxying for some HTTP backends (including Kestrel and Vite) and large responses by avoiding premature EOF handling and draining readable bytes on `POLLHUP` #84 #87
- Fixed `make krun-runner` builds on macOS

## 0.7.0

- Add experimental `krun` backend support (`--vmm krun` / `sandbox.vmm = "krun"`) with packaged runner binaries and krun boot assets in build manifests #70
- Add `postBuild.copy` for custom image builds, allowing host files/directories to be copied into the guest rootfs before `postBuild.commands`
- Improve custom image build reliability by preserving APK PAX long-path entries and zero-byte files during extraction
- Preserve OCI image UID/GID ownership metadata when assembling ext4 rootfs images from OCI sources
- Fix `postBuild.commands` shell detection for rootfs images where `/bin/sh` is an absolute symlink (for example Alpine minirootfs)
- Fix forced container builds (`container.force`) under rootless runtimes by moving Zig caches to writable in-container paths
- Improve guest source discovery for packaged installs so `gondolin build` works without requiring a separate local checkout in common cases
- Improve TCP/HTTP bridge stability under backpressure and disconnects to prevent stalled or poisoned pooled connections #71
- Normalize host filesystem RPC error propagation to canonical Linux errno values so guests receive consistent errors across macOS and Linux hosts

## 0.6.0

- Add support for OCI container images with customizable pull policies, layer caching, and rootfs safety checks. #53
- Add explicit host-mapped TCP egress rules (`tcp.hosts` / `--tcp-map`) for narrowly scoped non-HTTP workloads, using synthetic DNS per-host attribution
- Switched egress `httpHooks` to WHATWG `Request`/`Response` types and added support for returning synthetic responses from `onRequest` to short-circuit upstream fetches
- Added internal request/response conversion helpers and expanded HTTP hook/network test coverage (including undici compatibility and body-size guardrails)
- Updated networking/secrets docs to reflect the new hook API and short-circuit behavior
- Reworked host VFS loading to import vendored `node:vfs` directly from `src/vfs/node/vendored-node-vfs`, removing the custom loader and adding clearly tagged patch markers for upstream syncs
- Added `allowedInternalHosts` to `createHttpHooks()` for host-pattern-scoped internal-IP exceptions (without requiring duplicate `allowedHosts` entries), plus docs clarifying that `onRequest` short-circuit fetches run outside VM egress IP policy

## 0.5.0

- Add richer host-side `vm.fs` APIs (`access`, `mkdir`, `listDir`, `stat`, `rename`, streaming reads, and recursive deletes) for interacting with guest filesystems. #48
- Add configurable VM rootfs modes (`readonly`, `memory`, `cow`) and support asset-level default rootfs mode via `manifest.json`
- Add `gondolin snapshot` plus `gondolin bash --resume` to snapshot active sessions and restart from saved checkpoints

## 0.4.0

- Add bash fallback to `/bin/sh` for `gondolin bash` and `gondolin attach` when bash is unavailable
- Add VM registry and `gondolin attach`/`gondolin list` CLI commands to manage and connect to running VMs
- Fix `gondolin build` post-build `chroot` commands that require `/proc` by mounting procfs during hook execution
- Add `rmdir` support in `sandboxfs` fs-rpc so removing directories on VFS mounts no longer returns `ENOSYS`
- Improve `sandboxfs` FUSE compatibility with `RENAME2`, `FSYNCDIR`, `FALLOCATE`, and `COPY_FILE_RANGE` support via fs-rpc
- Improve FUSE fallback behavior by mapping `ioctl` to `ENOTTY`, mknod/xattr ops to `EOPNOTSUPP`, and logging unsupported opcodes only once
- Fix VFS metadata and permission checks by using `lstat` for symlink-sensitive paths and adding stat-based `access` fallback
- Update vendored `node:vfs` sources/docs to Node.js PR #61478 (including Windows path normalization fixes, mount lifecycle events, and expanded API limitations docs), while keeping Gondolin-specific provider patches (`RealFSProvider` hardening/extensions and `MemoryProvider` hard-link support)

## 0.3.0

- Added `httpHooks.onRequestHead` and streamed `Content-Length` request bodies to avoid buffering
- Add SSH authentication and an exec policy for controlled SSH access. #37
- Allow customizing `gondolin bash` (command, `cwd`, and environment variables). #38
- Add WebSocket proxying support in the network stack. #30
- Split HTTP policy hooks and add safer secret substitution options (incl. query params). #29
- Add snapshots and shadowing VFS providers. #15 #20
- Expand VFS/FUSE feature coverage (STATFS/`df`, links/symlinks, guest file I/O). #33
- Add configurable DNS modes and harden DNS parsing against compression-pointer attacks
- Improve sandbox UX (stdout/stderr backpressure, Ctrl+C handling, host HTTP gateway). #18 #22 #24
- Add tmpfs overlay root and additional custom image build hooks

## 0.2.1

- Run string exec commands via `/bin/sh -lc` for predictable shell behavior
- Add example Pi + Gondolin sandbox extension
- Documentation and CI improvements

## 0.2.0

- Add CLI startup feedback and QEMU dependency checks. #5

- Rewrite the image builder in TypeScript and introduce a configurable asset build pipeline
- Improve VM startup and QEMU microvm compatibility (virtio-mmio + serial console). #3
- Harden HTTP bridge behavior (limits, header handling, buffering, caching)
- Improve VFS provider correctness and expand automated test coverage
- Documentation site + guides overhaul

## 0.1.3
